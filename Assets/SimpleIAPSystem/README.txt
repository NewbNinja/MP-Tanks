INSTALLATION
************************************************

Please read the first chapter of the documentation PDF named "SimpleIAPSystem", included in the package, for further information about SIS and its installation guide.
Simple IAP System can work without Unity IAP, however if you would like to offer in-app purchases for real money, you have to download Unity IAP from the Package Manager first.
